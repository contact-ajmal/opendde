## What is OpenDDE?

OpenDDE is a self-hosted drug design workbench that chains together state-of-the-art computational biology tools into a single, cohesive workflow. Enter any protein drug target and instantly discover where drugs can bind, explore known compounds with experimental data, predict molecular interactions, and get AI-powered scientific insights — all from your browser.

The platform is designed for **academic researchers** exploring new drug targets, **pharmaceutical scientists** running computational screens, **students** learning drug design, and **biotech startups** needing professional target assessment without million-dollar software licenses. Everything runs locally via Docker Compose — no cloud GPU required, no vendor lock-in, no usage limits.

---

## Features

### Pocket Discovery
Predict druggable binding pockets on any protein using **P2Rank** machine learning. Each pocket is ranked by druggability score with detailed residue composition analysis (hydrophobic, polar, charged, aromatic ratios).

### Ligand Intelligence
Browse all known bioactive compounds from **ChEMBL** with experimental binding data (IC50, Ki, Kd). Sort by potency, filter by clinical phase, and see 2D molecular structures. Includes Lipinski Rule of Five druglikeness scoring via **RDKit**.

### Complex Prediction
Predict how drugs bind to targets using **AlphaFold 3**. Semi-automated workflow generates AF3 job files, handles upload, and renders predicted complexes in 3D with confidence metrics (iPTM, pLDDT).

### Affinity Prediction
Predict binding affinity (pIC50, IC50, binder probability) for protein-ligand pairs using **Boltz-2**. The pocket detail page shows predicted pKi alongside experimental ChEMBL values; the dedicated `/app/screen` page runs full virtual-screening campaigns across hundreds of ligands with live progress, ranked top-hits, and CSV export.

### Antibody Modeling
Predict antibody 3D structures from heavy and light chain sequences using **ImmuneBuilder**. CDR loops (H1-H3, L1-L3) are annotated and color-coded in the interactive viewer.

### AI Assistant
Claude-powered scientific assistant with full context about the current target, pockets, and ligands. Provides druggability analysis, suggests ligand modifications, explains results, and answers drug design questions.

### SAR Analysis
Structure-Activity Relationship scatter plots and automatic **activity cliff detection** — finding pairs of structurally similar molecules with dramatically different activities, revealing which chemical modifications matter most.

### Druggability Reports
Generate comprehensive target assessment reports in JSON and PDF formats. Includes pocket analysis, ligand landscape, safety signals from Open Targets, and an overall druggability score.

### Analytics Dashboard
Track exploration history with charts and metrics: targets explored over time, pocket score distributions, ligand activity ranges, and top targets by compound count.

### Additional Features
- **Pocket comparison** radar charts across multiple pockets
- **Similar target discovery** via sequence homology
- **Safety profiles** from Open Targets
- **CSV/PDF export** for all data
- **Command palette** (Cmd+K) for quick navigation
- **Dark/light theme** toggle

## For Researchers

OpenDDE accelerates the early stages of drug discovery — target assessment, pocket identification, and compound landscape analysis. Tasks that traditionally require expensive commercial software and weeks of manual work can be completed in minutes using freely available, state-of-the-art tools.

The platform is particularly valuable for researchers working on understudied targets ("dark" proteome), where limited prior data makes commercial databases less useful. By combining AlphaFold structure predictions with P2Rank pocket analysis and ChEMBL compound data, OpenDDE provides a comprehensive druggability assessment for any human protein — even those with no experimental crystal structure.

---

## Engine Swap Architecture

OpenDDE is designed with a modular **engine swap** pattern. Each computational tool is accessed through a standardized adapter interface, making it trivial to replace any engine as better alternatives emerge:

```python
class PocketEngine(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def predict(self, structure_path: str) -> list[Pocket]:
        ...

class P2RankEngine(PocketEngine):
    async def predict(self, structure_path: str) -> list[Pocket]:
        response = await httpx.post(f"{self.url}/predict", ...)
        return self._parse(response.json())

# Swap in a different engine with zero router changes
class FPocketEngine(PocketEngine):
    ...
```

| Function | Current Engine | Possible Alternatives |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Pocket prediction | P2Rank | FPocket, DeepSite, SiteMap |
| Structure prediction | AlphaFold 3 | Boltz-2, Chai-1, ESMFold |
| Affinity prediction | Boltz-2 | DiffDock, FEP+, AutoDock-GPU |
| Antibody modeling | ImmuneBuilder | ABodyBuilder3, IgFold |
| Cheminformatics | RDKit | OpenBabel, CDK |

### Using a remote GPU for Boltz-2

Local CPU inference takes 3–8 minutes per prediction, which is fine for trying things out but slow for real screening. For production use or large-scale screens, set `BOLTZ_SERVICE_URL` in `.env` to an endpoint running the same API on a GPU instance and the rest of the platform just works:

```bash
# .env
BOLTZ_SERVICE_URL=https://my-boltz-gpu.example.com
```

Compatible options:

- **NVIDIA Boltz2 NIM** — drop-in API, fastest path to production-grade throughput.
- **Self-hosted** — run the bundled `services/boltz` container on a GPU VM (AWS g5.xlarge, Lambda Labs A10, etc.) with `TORCH_VARIANT=cu121`.
- **Modal / Replicate / Runpod** — wrap the same service entrypoint in any of these serverless GPU platforms.

The frontend warmup banner and `/affinity/health` endpoint surface model-cache state regardless of where the service runs.

---

## Roadmap

- [x] **Boltz-2 integration** — Affinity prediction shipped in v3.2.0
- [x] **Batch screening** — `/app/screen` campaign runner shipped in v3.2.0
- [ ] **AutoDock Vina** — Local molecular docking without AlphaFold Server dependency
- [ ] **Collaborative features** — Shared workspaces and annotation
- [ ] **IsoDDE integration** — When API access becomes available
- [ ] **Protein-protein interaction** druggability analysis
- [ ] **ADMET prediction** — Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity
